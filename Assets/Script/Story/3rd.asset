  englishDialogue: 'During the period when the garbage mutated, humans discovered
    that the source was the influx of unknown infectious agents from outer space,
    causing the garbage to become contaminated. A year ago, monsters began to wreak
    havoc on the earth, making human beings miserable. When the disaster comes, the
    world instantly falls into panic. Many humans are killed by monsters. The streets
    are littered with corpses. The survivors can only flee in all directions, allowing
    monsters to spread throughout the earth. When mankind is at its most desperate,
    you are determined to become humanity''s hope and end garbage. '
